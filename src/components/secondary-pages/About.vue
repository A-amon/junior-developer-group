                    We're a small, international community with a main goal of
                    helping early career developers gain new skills, 
                    make meaningful connections and provide guidance to those 
                    entering their first roles in tech.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We started working together in December 2020 and have been building
                    projects, <br>
                    exploring Scrum ceremonies and debugging JavaScript ever since.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    We're run by Likii and our Admin Team who help us learn more, 
                    support our experiments and are always there to share some funny memes
                </p>

                <p> 
                    If you'd like to join us, collaborate with us or recruit some of our members,

                            <strong>Answer: </strong>

                            <p> For a large majority of our projects we use HTML/CSS and vanilla JavaScript. 
                                However, we're slowly moving on to building projects using JS frameworks such as Vue.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As for tools, we use Figma for our designs, Jira for ticket management (we work in sprints), Discord as a main communication platform and GatherTown for our group meetings.
                            </p>

                            <p> Links to all of the above can either be found in our site's footer or (if it's project related) inside of each project's readme files.</p>

                            <p> 
                                Since the group was created we've always tried to meet once a week. 
                                Sometimes, we will schedule an extra workshop/event which is always advertised
                                on our Discord channel in advance. 
                            </p>

                                In short, no. We run this group in a very casual way and we respect everyone has jobs and other responsibilities outside of it.
                                Participation is completely optional.
