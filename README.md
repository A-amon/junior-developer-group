    <span>1. Fork the repository (this will save a particular repo to your own profile)</span> <br/> <br/>
    <span>2. Clone the repository (this will download that particular repo to your computer and you'll have to pick where to 'save' it all)</span> <br/><br/>
    <span>3. Open the repository folder in Visual Studio Code (or an IDE of your choice)</span>  <br/> <br/>

<details><summary>ðŸŽ¯ How to get started | Ticket Management:</summary>  
    <br/>
    <span>1. Create a new branch and name it after your Jira ticket number and ticket title </span> <br/> <br/>
    <p> <strong>example:</strong> git checkout -b 'DEV-XXX-ticket-title' <br></p> <br/>
    <span>2. Start writing your code and once you're ready commit your changes and push to 'dev' branch</span> <br/> <br/>
    <p> <strong>example:</strong> git push origin 'dev' <br></p> <br/>
    <span><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> We use 'dev' branch as our 'staging enviroment'. Our 'main' branch is reserved and we don't pull/push there.</span>  <br/> <br/>

<details><summary>ðŸŽ¯ Repeated contributions | Extra Help </summary>  
    <br/>
    <span>1. You'll have to change from your previous branch back into our 'dev' branch (git checkout 'dev') </span> <br/> <br/>

    <span>3. Now when you've got your 'dev' branch updated, you can go ahead and create yourself a new branch</span> <br/> <br/>

    <span>4. Once you're done writing your changes, you'll have to commit and push your changes to 'dev' branch</span> <br/> <br/>
