            We're an international open-source community helping early career
            developers gain new skills, make meaningful connections and provide
            guidance to those entering their first roles in tech.
          </p>

          <p>
            We started working together in December 2020 and have been building
            projects, <br />
            exploring Scrum ceremonies and debugging JavaScript ever since.

                <div class="about-us_faq_answers">
                  <strong>Answer: </strong>

                  <p> For a large majority of our projects we use HTML/CSS and vanilla JavaScript. 
                      However, we're slowly moving on to building projects using JS frameworks such as Vue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      As for tools, we use Figma for our designs, Jira for ticket management (we work in sprints), Discord as a main communication platform and Gather for our Friday Focus Sessions.

                <div class="about-us_faq_answers">
                  <strong>Answer: </strong>

                  <p> The team is purposely created for beginners and junior developers alike. 
                      We have no skill or experience requirements and hope you'll be able to 
                      gain some while participating on our projects instead.

                <div class="about-us_faq_answers">
                  <strong>Answer: </strong>

                  <p> Since the group was created we've always met once a week. 
                      Always on Fridays at 7 PM UK Time. 
                      Sometimes we will schedule extra workshops/events which we also notify 
                      all of our members about before picking date/time for each one.

                <div class="about-us_faq_answers">
                  <strong>Answer: </strong>

                  <p> In short, no. We run this group in a very casual way and we respect everyone has jobs and other responsibilities outside of it.
                      Participation is completely optional.  
                  </p>
