                        and helping around created Pull Requests on our HacktoberFest repository.

                        <li> 
                            You'll need to be comfortable using Git/GitHub features 
                            <p> (seeing changes made on PR you're reviewing, accepting the PR, rejecting, 
                                approving, commenting on, tagging onto PRs, merging, solving conflicts etc)

                           You'll need to be comfortable reading other people's code
                            <p>(HTML/CSS/vanilla JS) </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            You'll need to be able to evaluate other people's code based on their current skill level
                            <p> (if they copied it from someone else, if their PR messed something else up on the page, 
                                if third party library/framework/plugin has been used, etc)

                         - until the challenge has passed. After HacktoberFest we'll be restarting our usual group activities and
                        Maintainers will get a chance to become Team Leads, depending on their 
                        HacktoberFest engagements and overall group activity.
